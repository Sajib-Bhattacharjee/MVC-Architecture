## `MVC-Architecture`
```Node
Modelâ€“viewâ€“controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user
interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done
to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and
accepted from the user. 
```


### `1.Model`
```Node
The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can
represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or
any other business logic-related data. For example, a Customer object will retrieve the customer 
information from the database, manipulate it and update it data back to the database or use it to 
render data.
```

### `2.View`
```Node
The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. For example, the Customer view 
will include all the UI components such as text boxes, dropdowns, etc. that the final user interacts
with.
```

### `3.Controller`
```Node
Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic 
and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render 
the final output. For example, the Customer controller will handle all the interactions and inputs from
the Customer View and update the database using the Customer Model. The same controller will be used to
view the Customer data.
